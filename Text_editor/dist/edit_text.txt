Online and offline crowd scenes video analysis posemany challenges on how to accurately detect panic situations. In this paper, we proposed a robust solution named DeepROD with the intentions to raise panic events in almost real-time fashion. Moreover, we have introduced an enhanced feature based on the gradient of the motion termed GoM to take into account the variations in motion magnitude, motion orientation, people interactions and crowd density, while being robust to the density level of the crowd. Furthermore, we developed a real-time detection model based on long shortterm memory (LSTM) neural network and a statistical characterization of non-panic behaviors to detect abnormal situations. The predictionmodel is able to operate either online or offline and is able to detect anomalous events with high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art solutions. The evaluation conducted over multiple well-known datasets authenticates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system. The main limitation of the proposed approach is that the performance is impacted by the spatial resolution of the input data. In future work, we will further reduce the computations required to process videos for higher responsiveness. This can be achieved through the use of parallel computing. Moreover, we will investigate the possibility of improving the detection performances by combining the data captured by different cameras from different views of the same public place.
